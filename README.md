# Awake

## Sprint 1:
Currently our app has the following features:
1. By hitting the FAB, the user can set an alarm (hrs/min and AM/PM)
2. Can toggle the alarm to be on or off
3. When the alarm goes off, the user must complete the activity to turn off the alarm.

Current problems:
1. Beyond setting the alarm, we need to implement customization of the alarm such as repeat, sound, name, etc, as well as pick different challenges
2. Alarm currently is not time sensitive. It goes off within a minute.
3. Alarm list autoclears after 1 alarm goes off.
4. Should have back button on set alarm activity.
